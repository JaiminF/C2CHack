				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is basic budgeting?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you’re new to budgeting, it’s important to understand what a budget is and how it helps you examine what you earn and how you are spending that income. A budget is a financial plan that takes income and expenses into account and provides estimates for how much you make and spend over a given period of time. </p>

					<p>Create a Monthly Budget

Add up your income. Determine your income mostly in form of Pocket Money.

Estimate your expenses. The best way to do this is to keep track of how much you spend in a month. To easily track your spending,divide your expenses into fixed costs and flexible expenses as food/entertainment. 

Figure out the difference. Once you’ve totaled up your yearly income and expenses, subtract the expense total from the income total to get the difference. It’s a simple step that can reveal a lot about your spending habits. 

Track it. Keep track of your monthly income and expenses to make sure you’re sticking to your budget. It may take time to find the balance that works for you.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I create a budget ?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Question Your Needs and Wants 
What do you want? What do you really need? Evaluate your current financial situation and make two lists — one for needs and one for wants. As you make the list, ask yourself the following:

-Why do I want it?
-How would things be different if I had it?
-Which things are important and essential to me?
-When your list is complete, reevaluate what qualifies as a need before making any purchases that will impact your budget.

2. Set Guidelines 
Keep your budget balanced with wants and needs by setting clear guidelines. If you splurge on a vacation, consider cutting other costs that month to offset that large expense. Take a look at this Budget Worksheet to get a sense of how to allocate your money for different expenses.

3. Track, Trim and Target
Once you start tracking, you may be surprised to find that you spend hundreds of dollars a month on eating out, entertainment or other discretionary expenses. To lower these costs, target areas where you can cut back on spending. Remember that reducing expenses is often a more realistic approach than cutting costs entirely.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Savings for me</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Throughout your life, you will be faced with many decisions about saving and spending. Your goals can vary from smaller purchases such as a new smartphone to larger purchases, such as a car or a house to long-term savings for retirement and any unknowns. There are some life events that you can plan and save for, like higher education or starting a family, but it’s impossible to foresee unplanned expenses. That’s what makes saving important — so you’ll be prepared for any type of expense by having money set aside.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I save without compromising?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Create a budget and stick to it. When you make a monthly budget, overestimate your expected costs. This way, you’ll likely end up with leftover funds, which can go right into savings.
Pay yourself first. Determine a set amount of money to put away every month and treat it like any other bill. Put away part of every paycheck — ideally 10 to 12 percent — and watch your savings grow.
Save wisely. Choose the right savings methods to match your goals, and make sure to do your research to find the best interest rates.
Be ready for the unknown. Create an emergency fund with three to six months’ worth of living expenses in case unexpected costs arise.
Set financial goals to keep you on track. Use SMART goals so you know exactly how much you want to save and how long it will take to get there. When you set clear goals, it’s a lot easier to track your progress.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I choose a saving option for myself?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>As per your needs,it can be either of the follows:
					Basic bank savings accounts offer the lowest interest rates, usually less than 1 percent. They come with few restrictions on access to your money, and they don’t usually have required minimum balances. These accounts associated with brick-and-mortar banks also can be accessed online.
Money market accounts are high-yield accounts that pay interest based on the current market rates. They are likely to require a higher minimum balance than a basic bank savings account.
Online savings accounts are typically similar to basic bank savings accounts, but they offer higher interest rates because they operate online and don’t involve the overhead that standard banks have.
Credit unions are like banks, but they’re owned by their members and may offer higher interest on savings.
Automatic savings plans are options you can set up for your savings account. You can choose to automatically transfer a set amount from your checking account to your savings account every month.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Financial institutions</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Just like any other business, a financial institution sells products to earn money so that it can run its operations and provide services. To understand how financial institutions operate, know that when you deposit money in a bank it gets pooled into a shared fund along with everyone else's.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I open an account of right type for myself?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>One common way to get a free checking account is to have your paycheck directly deposited into the account. This demonstrates that you intend to become a loyal customer with consistent deposits. Other ways to secure free checking include agreeing to keep a minimum balance in the account or agreeing to open a second account at the same bank.

Pay particularly close attention to the additional fees that a bank may charge. The two most common:

ATM Fees – If you withdraw cash from an ATM owned by a bank other than your own, your bank could charge you for a withdrawal outside the system, while the other bank charges you for not being one of its customers.
Overdraft Fees – Customers who withdraw money from an ATM or make a debit card purchase that exceeds the balance in their account will have to pay a penalty.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>5 Smart Debit Card Practices
Always know your current bank account balance and available funds.
Know your daily cash withdrawal and spending limits and contact your lender if you need to raise or lower amounts.
Use your debit card to get cash back when making purchases, to avoid ATM fees.
Receive free, automatic alerts to protect your account if:
ATM withdrawals or any debit card activity exceed your set dollar limits.
Your online ID or passwords change.
Large transactions are made.
If you plan on using your debit card across state and international lines, let your bank know ahead of time, to prevent fraud or security alerts.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is mobile banking?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>It may be new technology, but it enables you to complete almost all traditional banking actions and provides some new capabilities. With mobile banking, you’re able to check your balance, track your spending, review your account history, locate ATMs, deposit checks, transfer funds, pay bills and receive text message notifications or alerts about your account.
					Mobile banking serves a variety of financial purposes, but its best feature is the 24/7 access it gives you to your money. Whether you’re making purchases or depositing checks, you can do it from wherever and whenever you want. An added bonus is that most financial institutions don’t charge fees for mobile banking services. Also, most issuers provide their own mobile apps, tailored to their individual features and services.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I choose a card type?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Get to know credit cards with these 10 credit terms:

Annual Fee – The once-a-year cost of owning a credit card. Some credit card providers offer cards with no annual fees.
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) – The yearly interest rate charged on outstanding credit card balances.
Balance – An amount of money. In personal banking, balance refers to the amount of money in a savings or checking account. In credit, balance refers to the amount of money owed.
Credit Bureau – A reporting agency that collects information on consumer credit usage. There are currently three main credit bureaus in the United States: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Learn more about credit bureaus at usa.gov.
Credit Line – The maximum dollar amount that can be charged on a specific credit card account.
Credit Rating – A financial institution's evaluation of an individual's ability to manage debt. It’s crucial to have a good credit rating if you want to borrow money or apply for a credit card or loan. Learn how to maintain a strong credit score.
Grace Period – The period of time after a payment deadline when the borrower can pay back the borrowed money without incurring interest or a late fee.
Introductory Rate – An interest rate offered by credit card issuers in the initial stages of a loan. These rates are often set much lower than standard rates in order to attract new cardholders. Make sure you know how long the introductory rate will last and what the standard interest rate will be once the introductory period ends.
Minimum Payment – The minimum amount of money that you are required to pay on your credit card statement each month in order to keep the account in good standing.
Overdraft Protection – A banking service that allows you to link your checking account to your credit card, thereby protecting you from overdraft penalties or bounced checks in the case of insufficient funds.</p>

					<p>Complete credit applications carefully and accurately.
Use your credit cards responsibly — don’t let them reach their limit or spend beyond your means.
Choose your credit cards wisely and make sure you understand all of the terms and features.
Attempt to pay your credit card balance in full each month, but at least make the minimum payment by the due date.
Always pay bills on time.
If you have problems paying your bills, contact your creditors. In many cases, they will work with you to figure out a payment plan.
If you move, let your creditors know your new address as soon as possible to avoid losing bills or receiving them late.
If your credit card is lost or stolen, report it to the issuer immediately.
Check your credit reports periodically for inaccuracies and immediately report errors to resolve any issues.
Establish a consistent work history.</p>
